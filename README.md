# Personal Resume Repository for Oscar Wu

This repository contains the LaTeX files associated with the most up-to-date version of my resume. The PDF version of my resume is also included in this repository. Elements of the resume were initially inspired by the template in the link below, but the source script has been heavily revised to fit my current resume.[^f1]

[^f1]: See [GitHub - sb2nov/resume](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume) for the original template.
